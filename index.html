  <h1>Wilford Woodruff's Journals</h1>
  <p>This is my final deliverable for my Senior Project.</p>
  
  <h2>Map of Cities</h2>
  <div id="map"></div>
  
  <h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>This map shows the many cities in the United States that Wilford Woodruff has lived, traveled to, and journaled about throughout his life. Each point on the map depicts a different city and is colored based on how many times it was mentioned in Wilford's journals. The number of mentions in Wilford's journals and the city name can be viewed upon selecting each individual point. The pop-up text also includes a link that can allow you to view the different journal entries that mention that city.</p>
  
  <h3>Time Slider</h3>
  <p>This map also includes a time slider that allows you to filter the graph based on date. Using the slider allows you to visualize where Wilford has lived and traveled to over time.</p>
  
  <h3>Wilford Woodruff's Residence</h3>
  <p>Wilford Woodruff first arrived in Salt Lake City in 1847, which remained his primary residence for the rest of his life.</p>
  
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p>In my analysis, I looked at the different cities in the United States that Wilford Woodruff mentioned in his journals. Specifically, I wanted to see which cities were mentioned the most and how the locations of cities mentioned changed throughout his life. Salt Lake City, Utah is the most mentioned city in Woodruff's writings, with it being mentioned 875 times. Salt Lake City is significantly mentioned more than any other city, with the next closest being Nauvoo, Illinois, with 272 mentions. Ogden, Utah, Provo, Utah, and St. George, Utah are the next most mentioned cities.</p>
  
  <h3>Density of Utah</h3>
  <p>From the map, you can see that Utah is the most densely populated state. Although Woodruff didn't move to Utah until 1847, this is where he spent a majority of his life, which is why it makes sense that it is also one of the most widely traveled.</p>
  
  <h3>States Mentioned</h3>
  <p>In total, Wilford Woodruff mentions a total of 36 different states in his journals, with the top states being Utah, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Idaho.</p>
